/* HighlightInteractableOutline.cs
 * Creates an outline based on specified color, outline thickness, and resolution; attach this to any game object
 * with a sprite renderer to have a highlight effect when mouse hovers over the item, and stops highlighting
 * when mouse moves away from the item.
 * 
 * Creates an empty GameObject outlineParent to hold all the duplicate sprites (count is based on resolution), 
 * and places these based on 360ï¿½/resolution
 * 
 * Most of these calculations were created with trigonomety to calculate offsets, whose vector is then 
 * multiplied by outlineWidth to determine how far away from center the duplicate is placed.
 * 
 * Notes: Ensure GameObjects that you intend to interact with are on a layer visible to camera and have a 2D box
 * collider.
